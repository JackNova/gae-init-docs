  Before you begin you should go through the
  <a href="{{url_for('requirement')}}">requirements</a> and make sure that
  <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads">
    Google App Engine SDK for Python
  </a>
  and <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> are installed.
</p>

<p>
  We are also going to assume that you will follow all the suggested names
  for the directories and files, because in some steps we might refer to
  what was suggested without further explanations. If you decide to have
  your own names, continue at your own risk.
</p>

<p>
  In this
  tutorial we're not going to explain how Google App Engine works, so if you
  have never played with it before you should at least finish the
  <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/">Getting Started: Python 2.7</a>
  before continuing with this one.
