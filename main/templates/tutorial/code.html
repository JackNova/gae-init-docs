<p>Clone the gae-init project to get the code locally on your computer using git</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ git clone <span class="nocode">https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init.git phonebook</span>
</pre>

<p>If you are more familiar with mercurial then use that</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ hg clone <span class="nocode">https://bitbucket.org/gae-init/gae-init phonebook</span>
</pre>

<p>
  This will create a new directory that is called <code>phonebook</code>
  and inside that directory there is another directory called <code>main</code> that
  contains all the source files, libraries and more.
