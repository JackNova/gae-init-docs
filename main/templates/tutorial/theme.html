  Since gae-init uses Bootstrap there are plenty sites that are offering
  free and paid templates for it. Our personal favorite place to start is
  the <a href="http://bootswatch.com">Bootswatch.com</a>.
  For this example we are going to use the
  <a href="http://bootswatch.com/cerulean/">Cerulean</a>
  but feel free to choose whatever you want.
</p>

<p>
  Bootswatch is offering two options for downloading the themes: in pure CSS
  format or in LESS format. Since we are supporting LESS files is preferable
  to download the two LESS files that you can find for each of the themes.
</p>

<p>
  In order to experiment with more themes we will create a new directory
  called <code>theme</code> under the directory
  <code>main/static/src/less</code>. Inside this new directory for every
  theme that we would like to test, we will create another directory with it's own
  name.
</p>

<p>
  Follow the steps below for any theme that you would like to test from the
  Bootswatch's collection:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new directory called <code>cerulean</code></li>
  <li>Visit the <a href="http://bootswatch.com/cerulean/">Cerulean</a></li>
  <li>Download the <code>variables.less</code> and <code>bootswatch.less</code></li>
  <li>Put them in the new dicrectory <code>cerulean</code> under <code>main/static/src/less/theme</code></li>
</ol>

<p>
  After following these steps your directory structure should look like this:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
<i class="icon-folder-open"></i> static/
    <i class="icon-folder-open"></i> src/
        <i class="icon-folder-open"></i> less/
            <i class="icon-file"></i> base.less
            <i class="icon-folder-open"></i> theme/
                <i class="icon-folder-open"></i> cerulean/
                    <i class="icon-file"></i> bootswatch.less
                    <i class="icon-file"></i> variables.less
</pre>

<p>
  Open the <code>style.less</code> that is located in the
  <code>main/static/src/less</code> and add the following lines before the
  <code>@import base</code>
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
...
// Theme
@import "theme/cerulean/bootswatch";
@import "theme/cerulean/variables";
...
</pre>


<p>
  To test it locally you will have to compile the LESS files into CSS and this
  is achieved by using the <code>build.py</code> script. Run the script from the
  <code>main</code> directory like this (or you could provide the <code>-w</code>
  to monitor the LESS files for changes and compile them on save):
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
$ ./build.py -c
</pre>

<p>
  If the script compiled without any error then you should see the new
  theme by refreshing your browser or by visiting:
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080</a>
</p>
