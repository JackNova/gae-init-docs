  We assume that you are already know how to run the Google App Engine
  applications from a command line, but if not you should refer to the
  <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/helloworld">
    documentation
  </a>.
</p>
<p>
  Preferably in another terminal window run the <code>dev_appserver.py</code>
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ dev_appserver.py phonebook/main
</pre>

<p>
  Or you can run the command <code>dev_appserver.py .</code> within the
  <code>main</code> directory.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ cd phonebook/main
$ dev_appserver.py .
</pre>

<p>
  If everything went smoothly you can test the application by visiting
  the following URL in your web browser:
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>
</p>

<p>
  Feel free to spend some time by clickng on the different menus.

  As a first change withing the app you can signin in as adminstrator and
  after visiting the
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/admin/config/">http://localhost:8080/admin/config/</a>
  change the <strong>Brand Name</strong> to <strong>Phonebook</strong> (or
  to anything else you like). If everything went OK, on the top left corner
  you should see the new name for your application.
