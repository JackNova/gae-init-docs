  We assume that you are already know how to run the Google App Engine
  applications from a command line, but if not you should refer to the
  <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/helloworld">
    documentation
  </a>.
</p>
<p>
  Execute in your terminal the <code>run.py</code> from the root directory
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ cd /path/to/phonebook
$ ./run.py -s
</pre>

<p>
  If everything went smoothly you can test the application by visiting
  the following URL in your web browser:
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>
</p>

<p>
  Feel free to spend some time by clickng on the different menus.

  As a first change withing the app you can signin in as adminstrator and
  after visiting the
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/admin/config/">http://localhost:8080/admin/config/</a>
  change the <strong>Brand Name</strong> from <strong>gae-init</strong> to
  <strong>Phone Book</strong> (or to anything else you like). By doing that you
  should see on the top left corner the new name for your application.
