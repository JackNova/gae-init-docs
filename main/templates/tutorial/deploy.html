<p>
  Before deploying your application you must minify and uglify your styles
  and scripts because otherwise your latest changes won't appear online!
</p>

<p>
  To minify your styles and scripts execute the <code>run.py</code> script by
  providing the <code>-m</code> argument
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ ./run.py -m
</pre>

<p>
  After that make sure that you have created a new application on
  <a href="http://appengine.google.com">App Engine</a>
  and the name of the application is updated in the <code>app.yaml</code>
  file that is located in the <code>main</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
  To deploy your application execute the following command from the
  root directory:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ appcfg.py update main
</pre>

<p>
  Test your application by adding new contacts online!
