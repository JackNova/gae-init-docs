<p>
  The modules in which we will split our scripts. We have defined <code>libs</code> module 
  for our JavaScript libraries and <code>scripts</code> module for our custom scripts.
  Feel free to tailor it according to your needs. Each module will be loaded as a different 
  request when deployed.
