If you need more fine-grained control over who can access what, you can use
the `@auth.permission_required(permission)` decorator. It will only
allow accesses to the decorated function by registered users who were given
that permission (or admins). It works like this:


```python
@app.route('/moderate')
@auth.permission_required('moderator')
def moderate():
  return flask.render_template(...)
```

This will automagically register `'moderator'` as an available
permission which an admin can assign to individual users via the user list.
For convenience you can leave the `permission` string empty, which
will cause the permission to  named as the decorated function (so
`@auth.permission_required()` would introduce and check for the
permission `'moderate'` in the example above).
