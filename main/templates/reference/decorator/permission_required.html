<p>
  If you need more fine-grained control over who can access what, you can use
  the <code>@auth.permission_required(permission)</code> decorator. It will only
  allow accesses to the decorated function by registered users who were given
  that permission (or admins). It works like this:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
@app.route('/moderate')
@auth.permission_required('moderator')
def moderate():
  return flask.render_template(...)
</pre>

<p>
  This will automagically register <code>'moderator'</code> as an available
  permission which an admin can assign to individual users via the user list.
  For convenience you can leave the <code>permission</code> string empty, which
  will cause the permission to be named as the decorated function (so
  <code>@auth.permission_required()</code> would introduce and check for the
  permission <code>'moderate'</code> in the example above).
