    <strong>gae-init</strong> is nothing more than a collection of pretty
    awesome stack, organized in a small project to kickstart your next
    Google App Engine project.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    If you are already created a few App Engine projects you are aware of the fact
    that you need to spend some time setting up the project, getting the latest
    libraries, copying from older projects snippets that you've
    written already many times and you have to do some more boring stuff.
    This project is solving exactly that problem. It comes with
    the most nessesery stuff that are needed in any modern web application.
    No more wasting time on dealing with tools and start working on your next
    big thing right away!
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    <strong>gae-init</strong> is always up to date with the latest
    libraries and following the best practices. Check out the full

    I'm <a href="https://plus.google.com/104819677623449341855/">Lipis</a>
    and I'm the guy behind this project. Yes I've finished the
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/introduction">Getting Started Tutorial</a>
    and after that I've read most of the
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/">manual</a>.
    This project wouldn't be here without the old
    fellas,
    <a href="https://plus.google.com/111355104274934452159/">Mr. Tim</a> and
    <a href="https://plus.google.com/105306298257899269942/">Mr. Chris</a>
    that contributed with ideas, code, RedBulls, other stuff
    and the pretty awesome logo that was made by
    <a href="https://plus.google.com/102598378133436784997/">Mr. Kostas</a>.
    Also special thanks goes to <a href="https://github.com/gmist">gmist</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/joernhees">joernhees</a> and
    <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanlindmark">stefanlindmark</a>
    for testing and contributing with their time, code and ideas.

    Some may ask why not using something that is already there like
    <a href="https://github.com/coto/gae-boilerplate">gae-boilerplate</a>
    or <a href="https://github.com/kamalgill/flask-appengine-template">flask-appengine-template</a>.
    The answer is that, among other many things,
    <a href="https://github.com/coto/gae-boilerplate/blob/master/boilerplate/templates/base.html">gae-boilerplate's base.html</a>
    is huge, unreadable and a bit chaotic compare to
    <a href="https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init/blob/master/main/templates/base.html">gae-init's base.html</a>
    and that <em>flask-appengine-template</em> doesn't even have the pretty useful user sign-in.
