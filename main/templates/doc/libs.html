  Gae-init provides a very easy and flexible way for integrating libraries into your
  project.

  There are two type of extra libraries you can include in your projects. For
  every type of library we will describe follows an example of it being used
  in the project.

<p>
  The libraries you can use server side are separated in two categories.
